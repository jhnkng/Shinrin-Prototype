I like to scratch out ideas very loosely, and then try to find some order from the chaos I leave on paper. I like to add ideas using post-it notes, and I even cut up the notes and stick it back together in different order.\\n\\nTry as I might, I've not managed to replicate that experience digitally. I've tried kanban board style solutions, or wiki / document building services, and while I still use them I find for that it doesn't work for me during the very first thinking process."
