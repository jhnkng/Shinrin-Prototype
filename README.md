# Shinrin-Prototype
A prototype for Shinrin.app, superseded by a much newer version rewritten in JavaScript.

I originally wrote this as away to learn programming, I'm a big beliver in learning-by-doing. I was a total beginner and I worked on this while I was learning how to code in Python. I had the backend working fine, but because I didn't know how to code the frontend I eventually switched to learning JavaScript and over time I rewrote the backend in Node.js instead.

Note that if you spin this up the login doesn't work -- I was in the middle of refactoring when I decided to start over in Node.js instead. If you pass in a user key in the url it should load something (try /app/new).

To see the current iteration, try the app at [Shinrin.app](http://shinrin.app).
