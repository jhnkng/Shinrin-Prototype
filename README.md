# Shinrin-Prototype
A prototype for Shinrin.app, superseded by a much newer version rewritten in JavaScript.

I originally wrote this as away to learn programming, I'm a big beliver in learning-by-doing. I was a total beginner and I worked on this while I was learning how to code in Python. The backend works fine, but because I didn't know how to code the frontend I eventually switched to learning JavaScript and over time I rewrote the backend in Node.js instead.

Try the app at [Shinrin.app](http://shinrin.app).
