Your user key is bottom left of screen. Any changes you make here will be stored, if you would like to come back to your changes please login using the key. Data is stored as a simple JSON file, and there is NO ENCRYPTION or any data protection -- please don't enter anything that is even remotely personal! \\n\\n3. The system is built to save after changes, so if you have a text window open for a long time but never close, the work won't be saved. Shinrin is designed for short text snippets, so use it that way and you shouldn't have any problems.\\n\\n4. Quotes and double quotes (and probably a bunch more characters) break some functionality, so be careful.\\n\\n5. If you find any other bugs, please let me know!"

Move your mouse to the top of the card or list and you should see a two line icon show up -- grab that and drag away.\\n\\nThe + sign is for adding cards, and the arrow is to make the list wider or narrower as required.\\n\\nThere's no hard limit for the number of cards or lists you can have on screen. I don't know what happens when you have too many, try it and let me know!"

If you need to find your cards please use the Open Archives list on the main menu, and from there you should be able to find all the cards you've every created. If you click on the edit link in each card you can choose to delete the card, but again, it won't be deleted from the system, just removed from view. You'll be able to find them again in the Archives."
