Edit mode is the pencil icon on the top right of each card, and when you want to save press CTRL+S. To cancel press ESC.\n3. The card editor supports Markdown, but it's a bit janky.",

Heroku can be slow at times so that plus maybe some convoluted logic on the backend means occasionally it doesn't work.\n3. You still can't delete cards. It's on my list of todos!",
