I like to add ideas using post-it notes, and I even cut up the notes and stick it back together in different order.\\n\\nTry as I might, I've not managed to replicate that experience digitally. I've tried Kanban board style solutions, and wiki / document building services, and while I find uses for them I find for that it doesn't work for me during the very first thinking process.\\n\\nThe biggest problem I have is that I have to make all these decisions up front. What do I call it? Where do I save it? Kanban apps solve some of those problems, but they're designed as a type of to-do list so once I get my thoughts down I inevitably have to get move it to another app to fill out my thoughts."

But what do I do with it? My flashcard app can't take notes, and even if I can I can't make a quiz or use that as a flashcard. So the next big set of features I'm planning for Shinrin is language learning tools like a Spaced Repetition Flashcard tool, and a pomodoro timer that can be dropped in just like a card.
